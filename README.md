# Slideshow

Simple Laravel components for allowing user generated "slides", for when you can't talk them out of using a carousel.

Each slide may consist of a:
* Image or video (normally for background)
* Slide text (up to 60 characters)
* Button/CTA text
* CTA link
* A selected colour

NB: This package does not include any view or front end implementation.
